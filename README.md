# Dillinger

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Version
3.2.7

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Marked] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
```

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] dillinger
$ cd dillinger
$ npm i -d
$ gulp build --prod
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins

* Dropbox
* Github
* Google Drive
* OneDrive

Readmes, how to use them in your own application can be found here:

* [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb]
* [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh]
* [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd]
* [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd]

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma start
```

### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image. 

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:latest .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Once done, run the Docker and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 80 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:latest
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

### N|Solid and NGINX

### How to run with new database configuration:

In the data folder exists psycopg2-2.6.1-cp35-none-win_amd64.whl.  
Run in cmd or terminal:  
```sh
$ pip install psycopg2-2.6.1-cp35-none-win_amd64.whl
```
- Install [PostgreSQL]  
- I also suggest watching [this video] (use port 3304)
- Follow the video and look in the installation folder/bin of PostgreSQL for pgAdmin3 and run it (I suggest creating a shortcut)  
- Create a database called 'rise'

In cmd or terminal in the respository:
```sh
$ python manage.py makemigrations client
$ python manage.py migrate
```

All done! Run with:
```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
```
